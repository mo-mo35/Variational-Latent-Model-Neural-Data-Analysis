  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>As methods for recording neural data advance rapidly in both volume and speed, neurophysiologists face increasing challenges in developing innovative techniques to assess and sort incoming spike signals (neuron firing rates) and inferring relationships between neural activities across different brain regions. We seek to create and utilize a method for extracting shared and independent latent features that accurately represent interpretable neural population dynamics across distinct brain regions.</p>

  <p>The model we wish to construct builds on four main core components that serve as the foundation, allowing it to operate as we desire it to. These four components are: the Factor Analysis (FA) framework, the Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes (AEVB) framework, Probabilistic Canonical Correlation Analysis (pCCA), and Gaussian Processes (GPs). These components will be the key pieces used to build our two-step model pipeline that we will be inputting our data into: variational Latent Gaussian Process model (vLGP) and pCCA model. By using these core principles, our latent variable model will be able to extend the principles of factor analysis to extract latent representations within neural data to provide more interpretable firing rate dynamics than other current methods.</p>

    <h3>IBL Data</h3>
    <p>Using data collected by the International Brain Laboratory, we aim to analyze the latent behaviors of multiple regions of the brain in mice during standardized experiments. In these experiments, mice, with up to two probes recording 384 channels inserted into their brains, undergo a decision-making task where they are shown a stimulus of several different contrast strengths and is to move a wheel to center the stimulus on a screen. The IBL database contains large amounts of neural data (about 621,733 neurons) collected from 699 insertions of Neuropixel probes using 139 different mice over many experiment trials. These experiments give insight into regions and times in the brain that show sensitivity to stimulus, movement, reward, vision, and decision making.</p>

    <p>We will be using spike train data that have been presorted into the groups that present themselves as the sources of the voltage changes. These clusters are sometimes hard to identify as a single neuron, a cluster of neurons, or perhaps a mixture of noise from neighboring sources, so labels have been assigned (1 being a good cluster, 0 being bad/unclear) to each cluster recorded in a session. The spike trains from good clusters will be the main focus of our work in finding representative latent variables.</p>

    <p>We seek to test firstMove, stimOn (and its contrast strength), and feedbackType. These represent the first movement of the mouse in each trial, the moment the stimulus appears on the screen, the strength of the contrast of the stimulus, and the reward/punishment the mouse receives after they make a decision, respectively. </p>

    <p> For each of these events, we performed a permutation test for each time interval and, using the False Discovery Rate to control our rate of Type I errors across trials, filtered for clusters with at least 5 statistically significant (alpha level = 0.005) time bins. Additionally, we tested each clusters correct/incorrect and left/right sensitivity by contrast strength levels. Through this exploration, we were able to select two of the most sensitive brain regions to pass through our model pipeline.</p>

    <h3>Variational Latent Gaussian Process (vLGP) Model</h3>
    <p>The first model our data will be put through is a variational Latent Gaussian Process (vLGP) model, which is primarily used in neuroscience to decode neural data into a more interpretable lower-dimensional latent space governed by Gaussian Processes. The first model our data will be put through is a variational Latent Gaussian Process(vLGP) model, which is primarily used in neuroscience to decode neural data into a more interpretable lower-dimensional latent space governed by Gaussian Processes. vLGP assumes that the activity of a neuron at a particularly chosen time is drawn from the poisson distribution which in return causes the prior and posterior to be non-conjugate. Because of this, we would need to predict the posterior value of the latent process. To do so, we leverage variational inference to minimize the difference between the predicted posterior and the real posterior. Through variational inference, we maximize the ELBo which in turn minimizes the difference between the predicted and real posterior. </p>
    <p>This model uses necessary imports from essential libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and the vLGP-specific library developed by Yuan Zhao and Il Memming Park to handle computations and visualizations.</p>

    <h3>Probabilistic Canonical Correlation Analysis (pCCA) Model</h3>
    <p>The next and final step of our pipeline involves a probabilistic Canonical Correlation Analysis (pCCA) model. The primary goal of pCCA is to find pairs of linear transformations that reveal correlation in the latent space between two separate sets of data. This assumes the two datasets have a shared latent space as well as their own individual latent spaces. In the field of neuroscience, pCCA is typically used to model latent variables that explain the variability between two or more modalities of data, which helps to understand complex neural dynamics.</p>

    <figcaption>Fig.7 - Probabilistic Canonical Correlation Analysis Visualization</figcaption>
    <p>After the IBL data is collected and cleaned, it is first put through the vLGP model to smoothen and move the data to a lower-dimensional latent space. Then, the vLGP model's output fitted to the pCCA model in order to find shared and independent behavior among the latent signals.</p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>Our results from fitting the vLGP model with good clusters (cells that have highest confidence of signal classification) from the most dense region, (SCdg, where the highest quantity of clusters sensitive to the stimulus appearing were found), resulted in similar patterns for both left and right-positioned stimulus trials but slightly different positions. We can see that the pattern is similar across the first movement event in our second region SCiw. The shape is different in each region, but in both cases there is some uniqueness to the left and right trials where they encompass different ranges in the latent space. This could be a result of the fact that this is subsections of a larger brain region, poor spike variability, or perhaps the region lacks the capacity to differentiate left versus right as effectively as others.</p>
  
  <strong>Superior Colliculus Intermediate White Layer (SCIW)</strong>: Contains fiber tracts that connect various layers within the superior colliculus and link it with other brain regions. While not directly processing sensory inputs, it facilitates the transmission of motor commands that underlie orienting responses and visually guided actions.

  <p>We can also see from plotting the latent trajectories from both regions the signals that fire or move together and can decompose the latents into the different signals to observe how they compare between regions. </p>

  <p>We can see how the signals are enmeshed in certain areas and can be confirmed with the shared latents from the decomposed graph. There are results and decompositions for every event type.

  <h2>Conclusions</h2>
  <p>Assessing the performance of our model, we used the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and the R-squared coefficient. RMSE measures the average difference between predicted values and actual values. On the other hand, R-squared measures the proportion of variance explained by the latent variables in the PCCA model. Below we measure how well the canonical directions from our pCCA fitting can capture information </p>

  <figcaption>Fig.13 - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared</figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <p> Our ability to reconstruct the latent variables improves as we increase the number of directions we use, but diminishing returns in improvement can also be argued, and would require further exploration on different brain regions and latents. We also tested a comparison of our work against a simple PCA model. </p>

  </figure>
  
  <p>Our model structure allows us to prioritize interpretable, shared and unique latent trajectories and dynamics in return for a tradeoff in accuracy and variational capture. Further work could be done in testing the robustness and strengths of the model on different quantities of latents fitted, less confident clusters, different brain regions, a different selection criteria, other methods to find shared correlations between latent structures or any combination of the above. </p>
